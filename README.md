Notes:
  So I couldn't fix the issue with merge sorted and remove duplicates removes too many numbers. I asked my brother for help and went through stack overflow and one chegg page to see what I was doing wrong and for a bit more guidance on where to start. I submitted late because my times are all messed up but I forgot that it was for March 22nd, not 23rd.
